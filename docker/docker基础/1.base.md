# 准备 

以Centos7为例，docker要求操作系统必须为64位，且Centos内核版本位3.1及以上 

uname命令用于查看系统内核版本信息 ： uname -r 

 

卸载旧版本 docker
·systemctl stop docker

yum list installled | grep docker 

yum -y remove … 

卸载后保留 /var/lib/docker的内容（镜像、容器、存储卷和网络等） 

rm rf /var/lib/docker 


# 安装 
## docker的基本组成
* 镜像
    Docker 镜像（Image）就是一个只读的模板。镜像可以用来创建 Docker 容器，一个镜像可以创建很多容器。它也相当于是一个root文件系统。比如官方镜像 centos:7 就包含了完整的一套 centos:7 最小系统的 root 文件系统。相当于容器的“源代码”，docker镜像文件类似于Java的类模板，而docker容器实例类似于java中new出来的实例对象。
* 容器
* 仓库

## 安装步骤 

* CentOS7安装Docker：https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/
* 安装步骤
    * 确定你是CentOS7及以上版本
    * cat /etc/redhat-release
    * 卸载旧版本
* 安装最新版本docker-ce -y 

yum install docker-ce -y 

* 安装制定版本docker-ce，可使用以下命令查看可安装版本 

yum list docker-ce.x86.64 --showduplicates | sort -r 

* 安装完成后查看版本 docker version 

* yum安装gcc相关
    CentOS7能上外网   
    yum -y install gcc   
    yum -y install gcc-c++

1. 安装依赖软件包 

yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persisten-data lvm2 


2. 安装前可查看device-mapper-persisten-data 和lvm2是否已安装 

rpm -qa|grep device-mapper-persisten-data 

rpm -qa|grep lvm2 

3. 设置yum源 

yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo 

4. 更新yun软件包引擎 

yum makecache fast 

5. 安装DOCKER CE
yum -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

6. 启动docker
systemctl enable docker 设置docker开机自启 

systemctl  start docker   启动docker 

## 配置镜像加速 

拉取镜像速度 
![](./imgs/img1.png)
阿里云/时速云/网易云 

1. 注册登录开通阿里云容器镜像服务 

2. 查看控制台，找到镜像加速器并复制自己的加速器地址 

3. 找到/etc/docker目录下的daemon.json文件，没有则直接vi daemon.json 

4. 加入以下配置 

填写自己的加速器地址 

{ 

"registry-mirror":["https://zfzbet67.mirror.aliyuncs.com"] 

} 

5. 通知systemd重载此配置文件 

systemctl  daemon-reload 

6. 重启docker服务 

systemctl  restart docker 

 


镜像：将软件环境打包好，用来创建容器，一个镜像可以创建多个容器。 

镜像：是分层结构 

![](./imgs/img2.png)
Debian：基础镜像（Base Image） 

联合挂载技术：重复镜像会进行整合（Image） 

aritable:应用层 (可读写层，其下均为只读层) 

 

namespace:资源隔离 

cgroup:资源限制 

AUFS：挂载（高级多层统一文件系统） 

## hello world

docker run hello-world
## 底层原理
* 为什么Docker会比VM虚拟机快?
(1)docker有着比虚拟机更少的抽象层 
    由于docker不需要Hypervisor(虚拟机)实现硬件资源虚拟化,运行在docker容器上的程序直接使用的都是实际物理机的硬件资源。因此在CPU、内存利用率上docker将会在效率上有明显优势。
(2)docker利用的是宿主机的内核,而不需要加载操作系统OS内核 
    当新建一个容器时,docker不需要和虚拟机一样重新加载一个操作系统内核。进而避免引寻、加载操作系统内核返回等比较费时费资源的过程,当新建一个虚拟机时,虚拟机软件需要加载OS,返回新建过程是分钟级别的。而docker由于直接利用宿主机的操作系统,则省略了返回过程,因此新建一个docker容器只需要几秒钟



# Docker常用命令

## 帮助启动类命令
* 启动docker： systemctl start docker
* 停止docker： systemctl stop docker
* 重启docker： systemctl restart docker
* 查看docker状态： systemctl status docker
------------------------------------------
* 开机启动： systemctl enable docker
* 查看docker概要信息： docker info
* 查看docker总体帮助文档： docker --help
* 查看docker命令帮助文档： docker 具体命令 --help

## 镜像命令
* 罗列出本地主机上的***镜像***： docker images

|选项       |说明         |
|--------- |-------------|
|REPOSITORY|表示镜像的仓库源|
|TAG       |镜像的标签版本号|
|IMAGE ID  |镜像ID        |
|CREATED   |镜像创建时间   |
|SIZE      |镜像大小       |

同一仓库源可以有多个 TAG版本，代表这个仓库源的不同个版本，我们使用 REPOSITORY:TAG 来定义不同的镜像。    
如果你不指定一个镜像的版本标签，例如你只使用 ubuntu，docker 将默认使用 ubuntu:latest镜像  
【OPTIONS】说明：
-a :列出本地所有的镜像（含历史映像层）   
-q :只显示镜像ID。   

* 查镜像： docker search  [OPTIONS] 某个XXX镜像名字
【OPTIONS】说明：
--limit:只列出N个镜像，默认25个 eg:·docker search --limit 5 redis

* 下载镜像： docker pull 某个XXX镜像名字[:TAG]
没有TAG就是最新版

查看镜像/容器/数据卷所占的空间： docker system df 

* 删除镜像：docker rmi [-f] 某个XXX镜像名字/镜像ID
  删除多个镜像：docker rmi [-f] 某个XXX镜像名字1:tag 某个XXX镜像名字2:tag
  删除全部镜像：docker rmi -f $(docker images -qa)
-f :force强制删除
***面试题：谈谈docker虚悬镜像是什么？**
**仓库名、标签**都是<none>的镜像，俗称虚悬镜像dangling image

## 容器命令
！！docker 必须部署在linux内核的系统上
有镜像才能创建容器，这是根本前提(下载一个CentOS或者ubuntu镜像演示)

本次演示用ubuntu演示

* 新建+启动容器： docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
【OPTIONS】说明：
有些是一个减号，有些是两个减号
 
--name="容器新名字"       为容器指定一个名称；
-d: **后台运行容器**并返回容器ID，也即启动守护式容器(后台运行)；
 
**-i：以交互模式运行容器，通常与 -t 同时使用；**
**-t：为容器重新分配一个伪输入终端，通常与 -i 同时使用；**
也即**启动交互式容器(前台有伪终端，等待交互)；**
  
-P: 随机端口映射，大写P(访问docker--找redis)[-P 6379:76370] 
-p: 指定端口映射，小写p

实例:使用镜像centos:latest以交互模式启动一个容器,在容器内执行/bin/bash命令。

docker run -it centos /bin/bash(交互命令的接口)
以centos为镜像，在本地运行了一个微小板自带centos的linux内核的操作系统   

参数说明：
-i: 交互式操作。
-t: 终端。
centos : centos 镜像。
/bin/bash：放在镜像名后的是命令，这里我们希望有个交互式 Shell，因此用的是 /bin/bash。
要退出终端，直接输入 exit:


* 列出当前所有正在运行的***容器***：docker ps [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS说明（常用）：
 
-a :列出当前所有**正在运行**的容器+历史上**运行过的**
-l :显示最近创建的容器。
-n：显示最近n个创建的容器。
-q :**静默模式，只显示容器编号**。

* 退出容器
exit（run进去容器，exit退出，容器停止）
ctrl+p+q（run进去容器，ctrl+p+q退出，容器不停止）
* 启动已停止运行的容器： docker start 容器ID或者容器名

* 重启容器：docker restart 容器ID或者容器名
* 停止容器：docker stop 容器ID或者容器名

* 强制停止容器：docker kill 容器ID或容器名
* 删除已停止的容器 ：docker rm 容器ID
* 一次性删除多个容器实例
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)   
docker ps -a -q | xargs docker rm   ：docker ps -a -q的结果传递给了xargs，然后执行删除
⚠️：重要
1. 有镜像才能创建容器，这是根本前提(下载一个Redis6.0.8镜像演示)
2. 在大部分的场景下，我们希望 docker 的服务是在后台运行的， 我们可以过 -d 指定容器的后台运行模式。
docker run -d 容器名
**问题：**然后docker ps -a 进行查看, 会发现容器已经退出
**很重要的要说明的一点:** Docker容器后台运行,就必须有一个前台进程. 

容器运行的命令如果不是那些一直挂起的命令（比如运行top，tail），就是会自动退出的。  
这个是docker的机制问题,比如你的web容器,我们以***nginx为例***，正常情况下,我们配置启动服务只需要启动响应的service即可。

例如:service nginx start

但是,这样做,nginx为后台进程模式运行,就导致docker前台没有运行的应用,这样的容器后台启动后,会立即自杀因为他觉得他没事可做了.

所以，最佳的解决方案是,将你要运行的程序以前台进程的形式运行，
常见就是命令行模式，表示我还有交互操作，别中断. 

---------------------------------------
* 前台交互式启动 :docker run -it redis:6.0.8
* 后台守护式启动: docker run -d redis:6.0.8
---------------------------------------
* 查看容器日志: docker logs 容器ID
* 查看容器内运行的进程: docker top 容器ID
* 查看容器内部细节 :docker inspect 容器ID
--------------------------------------
* 进入正在运行的容器并以命令行交互: docker exec -it 容器ID bashShell
* 重新进入docker attach 容器ID
区别：
* attach 直接进入容器启动命令的终端，不会启动新的进程 用exit退出，会导致容器的停止。  
* exec 是在容器中打开新的终端，并且可以启动新的进程 用exit退出，不会导致容器的停止。【推荐】   

***一般用-d后台启动的程序，再用exec进入对应容器实例***

* 从容器内拷贝文件到主机上：docker cp  容器ID:容器内路径 目的主机路径

* 导入和导出容器
    - export 导出容器的内容留作为一个tar归档文件[对应import命令]
    - import 从tar包中的内容创建一个新的文件系统再导入为镜像[对应export]

    - 案例 ：docker export 容器ID > 文件名.tar
    - cat 文件名.tar | docker import - 镜像用户/镜像名:镜像版本号
## 总结

# Docker镜像

## 是什么
是一种轻量级、可执行的独立软件包，它包含运行某个软件所需的所有内容，我们把应用程序和配置依赖打包好形成一个可交付的运行环境(包括代码、运行时需要的库、环境变量和配置文件等)，这个打包好的运行环境就是image镜像文件。

只有通过这个镜像文件才能生成Docker容器实例(类似Java中new出来一个对象)。

### 分层的镜像
以我们的pull为例，在下载的过程中我们可以看到docker的镜像好像是在一层一层的在下载   
docker pull tomcat
### UnionFS（联合文件系统）：Union文件系统
（UnionFS）是一种分层、轻量级并且高性能的文件系统，它支持对文件系统的修改作为一次提交来一层层的叠加，同时可以将不同目录挂载到同一个虚拟文件系统下(unite several directories into a single virtual filesystem)。Union 文件系统是 Docker 镜像的基础。***镜像可以通过分层来进行继承***，基于基础镜像（没有父镜像），可以制作各种具体的应用镜像。   
特性：一次同时加载多个文件系统，但从外面看起来，只能看到一个文件系统，联合加载会把各层文件系统叠加起来，这样最终的文件系统会包含所有底层的文件和目录
## Docker镜像加载原理
 docker的镜像实际上由一层一层的文件系统组成，这种层级的文件系统UnionFS。
bootfs(boot file system)主要包含bootloader和kernel, bootloader主要是**引导加载kernel**, Linux刚启动时会加载bootfs文件系统，在 ***Docker镜像的最底层是引导文件系统bootfs***。这一层与我们典型的Linux/Unix系统是一样的，包含boot加载器和内核。当boot加载完成之后整个内核就都在内存中了，此时内存的使用权已由bootfs转交给内核，此时系统也会卸载bootfs。
 
rootfs (root file system) ，在bootfs之上。包含的就是典型 Linux 系统中的 /dev, /proc, /bin, /etc 等标准目录和文件。rootfs就是各种不同的操作系统发行版，比如Ubuntu，Centos等等。 
* 平时我们安装进虚拟机的CentOS都是好几个G，为什么docker这里才200M？？

对于一个精简的OS，rootfs可以很小，只需要包括最基本的命令、工具和程序库就可以了，因为底层直接用Host的kernel，自己只需要提供 rootfs 就行了。由此可见对于不同的linux发行版, bootfs基本是一致的, rootfs会有差别, 因此不同的发行版可以公用bootfs。
**为什么 Docker 镜像要采用这种分层结构呢**
镜像分层最大的一个好处就是**共享资源**，方便复制迁移，就是为了复用。
 
比如说有多个镜像都从相同的 base 镜像构建而来，那么 Docker Host 只需在磁盘上保存一份 base 镜像；
同时内存中也只需加载一份 base 镜像，就可以为所有容器服务了。而且镜像的每一层都可以被共享。
## 重点理解
**Docker镜像层都是只读的，容器层是可写的**当容器启动时，一个新的可写层被加载到镜像的顶部。 这一层通常被称作“容器层”，“容器层”之下的都叫“镜像层”。

所有对容器的改动 - 无论添加、删除、还是修改文件都只会发生在容器层中。只有容器层是可写的，容器层下面的所有镜像层都是只读的。

## Docker镜像commit操作案例
* docker commit提交容器副本使之成为一个新的镜像(例如：具备 vim)

* docker commit -m="提交的描述信息" -a="作者" 容器ID 要创建的目标镜像名:[标签名]

* 案例演示:ubuntu安装vim

1. 官网是默认下载的Ubuntu没有vim命令     
2. 我们自己commit构建的镜像，新增加了vim功能，可以成功使用。   

- 从Hub上下载ubuntu镜像到本地并成功运行
- 原始的默认Ubuntu镜像是不带着vim命令的

- 外网连通的情况下，安装vim
 docker容器内执行上述两条命令：
apt-get update 更新包管理工具
apt-get -y install vim 安装vim
 
- 安装完成后，commit我们自己的新镜像
![](./imgs/1)
- 启动我们的新镜像并和原来的对比

## 小总结
 
Docker中的镜像分层，支持通过扩展现有镜像，创建新的镜像。类似Java继承于一个Base基础类，自己再按需扩展。    
新镜像是从 base 镜像一层一层叠加生成的。每安装一个软件，就在现有镜像的基础上增加一层

# 本地镜像发布到阿里云

1. 阿里云开发者平台: https://promotion.aliyun.com/ntms/act/kubernetes.html

2. 创建仓库镜像
选择控制台-->容器镜像服务-->选择个人实例-->命名空间-->创建命名空间    
镜像仓库-->创建镜像仓库-->下一步-->本地仓库-->创建

3. 将镜像推送到阿里云registry
基本信息（管理界面脚本）
![](./imgs/2)

4. 将阿里云上的镜像下载到本地
docker pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/atguiguwh/myubuntu:1.1

# 本地镜像发布到私有库
* 官方Docker Hub地址：https://hub.docker.com/，中国大陆访问太慢了且准备被阿里云取代的趋势，不太主流。   
 
* Dockerhub、阿里云这样的公共镜像仓库可能不太方便，涉及机密的公司不可能提供镜像给公网，所以需要创建一个本地私人仓库供给团队使用，基于公司内部项目构建镜像。   
Docker Registry是官方提供的工具，可以用于构建私有镜像仓库   

步骤：
1. 下载镜像Docker Registry 
docker pull registry

2. 运行私有库Registry，相当于本地有个私有Docker hub   
docker run -d -p 5000:5000【主机：容器端口】  -v /zzyyuse/myregistry/:/tmp/registry --privileged=true registry    
默认情况，仓库被创建在容器的/var/lib/registry目录下，建议自行用容器卷映射，方便于宿主机联调

3. 案例演示创建一个新镜像，ubuntu安装ifconfig命令
- 从Hub上下载ubuntu镜像到本地并成功运行
- 原始的Ubuntu镜像是不带着ifconfig命令的  

外网连通的情况下，安装ifconfig命令并测试通过
docker容器内执行上述两条命令：
apt-get update
apt-get install net-tools

安装完成后，commit我们自己的新镜像   
公式：   
docker commit -m="提交的描述信息" -a="作者" 容器ID 要创建的目标镜像名:[标签名]   

命令：在容器外执行，记得
docker commit -m="ifconfig cmd add" -a="zzyy" a69d7c825c4f【容器id】 zzyyubuntu:1.2

启动我们的新镜像并和原来的对比


4. curl验证私服库上有什么镜像

curl -XGET http://192.168.111.162:5000/v2/_catalog
 
可以看到，目前私服库没有任何镜像上传过。。。。。
 
5. 将新镜像zzyyubuntu:1.2修改符合私服规范的Tag  

按照公式： docker tag 镜像:Tag Host:Port/Repository:Tag   

自己host主机IP地址，填写同学你们自己的，不要粘贴错误，O(∩_∩)O

使用命令 docker tag 将zzyyubuntu:1.2 这个镜像修改为192.168.111.162:5000/zzyyubuntu:1.2
 
***docker tag  zzyyubuntu:1.2  192.168.111.162:5000/zzyyubuntu:1.2***
 
6. 修改配置文件使之支持http(docker 默认加固，不支持http)   

2个配置中间有个逗号 ','别漏了，这个配置是json格式的。

vim命令新增如下注释内容：vim /etc/docker/daemon.json
```json
{
  //别无脑照着复制，registry-mirrors 配置的是国内阿里提供的镜像加速地址，不用加速的话访问官网的会很慢。
  "registry-mirrors": ["https://aa25jngu.mirror.aliyuncs.com"],
   //安全注册
  //"insecure-registries": ["192.168.111.162:5000"]
}
```
上述理由：docker默认不允许http方式推送镜像，通过配置选项来取消这个限制。====> 修改完后如果不生效，建议重启docker

7. push推送到私服库
docker push 192.168.111.162:5000/zzyyubuntu:1.2

8. curl验证私服库上有什么镜像2
curl -XGET http://192.168.111.162:5000/v2/_catalog

9. pull到本地并运行

docker pull 192.168.111.162:5000/zzyyubuntu:1.2
docker run -it 镜像ID /bin/bash

# Docker容器数据卷
坑：容器卷记得加入 --privileged=true
why:
Docker挂载主机目录访问***如果出现cannot open directory .: Permission denied***

解决办法：在挂载目录后多加一个--privileged=true参数即可

如果是CentOS7安全模块会比之前系统版本加强，不安全的会先禁止，所以目录挂载的情况被默认为不安全的行为，
在SELinux里面挂载目录被禁止掉了额，如果要开启，我们一般使用--privileged=true命令，扩大容器的权限解决挂载目录没有权限的问题，也即
使用该参数，container内的root拥有真正的root权限，否则，container内的root只是外部的一个普通用户权限。
## 是什么
卷就是目录或文件，存在于一个或多个容器中，由docker挂载到容器，但不属于联合文件系统，因此能够绕过Union File System提供一些用于持续存储或共享数据的特性：
卷的设计目的就是数据的持久化，完全独立于容器的生存周期，因此Docker不会在容器删除时删除其挂载的数据卷

一句话：有点类似我们Redis里面的rdb和aof文件   
将docker容器内的数据保存进宿主机的磁盘中    
运行一个带有容器卷存储功能的容器实例
docker run -it --privileged=true -v /宿主机绝对路径目录:/容器内目录      镜像名
## 能干嘛
*  将运用与运行的环境打包镜像，run后形成容器实例运行 ，但是我们对数据的要求希望是**持久化的**
 
Docker容器产生的数据，如果不备份，那么当容器实例删除后，容器内的数据自然也就没有了。
为了能保存数据在docker中我们使用卷。

特点：
1：数据卷可在容器之间共享或重用数据
2：卷中的更改可以直接实时生效，爽
3：数据卷中的更改不会包含在镜像的更新中
4：数据卷的生命周期一直持续到没有容器使用它为止

### 数据卷案例
1. 宿主vs容器之间映射添加容器卷
·直接命令添加
·命令
公式：docker run -it -v /宿主机目录:/容器内目录 ubuntu /bin/bash

docker run -it --name myu3 --privileged=true -v /tmp/myHostData:/tmp/myDockerData ubuntu /bin/bash   
·docker run -it --privileged=true -v /宿主机绝对路径目录:/容器内目录 镜像名
2. 查看数据卷是否挂载成功
docker inspect 容器ID 看:Mounts
3. 容器和宿主机之间数据共享
* docker修改，主机同步获得 
* 主机修改，docker同步获得
* docker容器stop，主机修改，docker容器重启看数据是否同步。

4. 读写规则映射添加说明
·读写(默认)
 rw = read + write
·docker run -it --privileged=true -v /宿主机绝对路径目录:/容器内目录:rw 镜像名
·默认同上案例，默认就是rw
·只读
·容器实例内部被限制，只能读取不能写

 /容器目录:ro 镜像名               就能完成功能，此时容器自己只能读取不能写  
 
ro = read only
 
此时如果宿主机写入内容，可以同步给容器内，容器可以读取到。
· docker run -it --privileged=true -v /宿主机绝对路径目录:/容器内目录:ro      镜像名


## 卷的继承和共享
·容器1完成和宿主机的映射
 
docker run -it  --privileged=true -v /mydocker/u:/tmp --name u1 ubuntu

·容器2继承容器1的卷规则  
docker run -it  --privileged=true --volumes-from 父类  --name u2 ubuntu

# Docker常规安装简介

## 总体步骤
·搜索镜像
·拉取镜像
·查看镜像
·启动镜像
- 服务端口映射
·停止容器
·移除容器

## 安装tomcat
·docker hub上面查找tomcat镜像
·docker search tomcat

·从docker hub上拉取tomcat镜像到本地
·docker pull tomcat

·docker images查看是否有拉取到的tomcat

·使用tomcat镜像创建容器实例(也叫运行镜像)
·docker run -it -p 8080:8080 tomcat
·-p 小写，主机端口:docker容器端口
-P 大写，随机分配端口
·i:交互
·t:终端
·d:后台

·访问猫首页
·问题(404)

·解决:可能没有映射端口或者没有关闭防火墙
·把webapps.dist目录换成webapps
·先成功启动tomcat

·查看webapps 文件夹查看为空

--------------------------

·免修改版说明
·docker pull billygoo/tomcat8-jdk8
·docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name mytomcat8 billygoo/tomcat8-jdk8

## 安装mysql
·docker hub上面查找mysql镜像

·从docker hub上(阿里云加速器)拉取mysql镜像到本地标签为5.7


·使用mysql5.7镜像创建容器(也叫运行镜像)
·命令出处，哪里来的？

·简单版
·使用mysql镜像
docker run -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123456 -d mysql:5.7  
docker ps   
docker exec -it 容器ID /bin/bash   
mysql -uroot -p   

·建库建表插入数据

·外部Win10也来连接运行在dokcer上的mysql容器实例服务

·问题
·插入中文数据试试[报错]

·为什么报错?
·docker上默认字符集编码隐患
 docker里面的mysql容器实例查看，内容如下：
 
 SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'character%'

·删除容器后，里面的mysql数据如何办
·容器实例一删除，你还有什么？ 删容器到跑路。。。。。？
·实战版
·新建mysql容器实例

docker run -d -p 3306:3306 --privileged=true -v /zzyyuse/mysql/log:/var/log/mysql -v /zzyyuse/mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql -v /zzyyuse/mysql/conf:/etc/mysql/conf.d -e    
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123456  --name mysql mysql:5.7


·新建my.cnf
·通过容器卷同步给mysql容器实例   
[client]
default_character_set=utf8
[mysqld]
collation_server = utf8_general_ci
character_set_server = utf8

·重新启动mysql容器实例再重新进入并查看字符编码

·再新建库新建表再插入中文测试


***结论***
 
之前的DB  无效
 
修改字符集操作+重启mysql容器实例
 
之后的DB  有效，需要新建
 
结论：docker安装完MySQL并run出容器后，建议请先修改完字符集编码后再新建mysql库-表-插数据
 
·假如将当前容器实例删除，再重新来一次，之前建的db01实例还有吗？trytry


## 安装redis
·从docker hub上(阿里云加速器)拉取redis镜像到本地标签为6.0.8
 

·入门命令
 

·命令提醒：容器卷记得加入--privileged=true
 
Docker挂载主机目录Docker访问出现cannot open directory .: Permission denied
解决办法：在挂载目录后多加一个--privileged=true参数即可
·在CentOS宿主机下新建目录/app/redis
 

 
1 建目录
  mkdir -p /app/redis
·mkdir -p /app/redis
·将一个redis.conf文件模板拷贝进/app/redis目录下
 

2 拷贝配置文件
  将准备好的redis.conf文件放进/app/redis目录下
·/app/redis目录下修改redis.conf文件
 
3 /app/redis目录下修改redis.conf文件
  3.1 开启redis验证    可选
    requirepass 123
 
  3.2 允许redis外地连接  必须
     注释掉 # bind 127.0.0.1

 
  3.3   daemonize no
     将daemonize yes注释起来或者 daemonize no设置，因为该配置和docker run中-d参数冲突，会导致容器一直启动失败
 
  3.4 开启redis数据持久化  appendonly yes  可选
 
 
 
 
·默认出厂的原始redis.conf

```
# Redis configuration file example.
#
# Note that in order to read the configuration file, Redis must be
# started with the file path as first argument:
#
# ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf
 
# Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
#
# 1k => 1000 bytes
# 1kb => 1024 bytes
# 1m => 1000000 bytes
# 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
# 1g => 1000000000 bytes
# 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.
 
################################## INCLUDES ###################################
 
# Include one or more other config files here.  This is useful if you
# have a standard template that goes to all Redis servers but also need
# to customize a few per-server settings.  Include files can include
# other files, so use this wisely.
#
# Notice option "include" won't be rewritten by command "CONFIG REWRITE"
# from admin or Redis Sentinel. Since Redis always uses the last processed
# line as value of a configuration directive, you'd better put includes
# at the beginning of this file to avoid overwriting config change at runtime.
#
# If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration
# options, it is better to use include as the last line.
#
# include /path/to/local.conf
# include /path/to/other.conf
 
################################## MODULES #####################################
 
# Load modules at startup. If the server is not able to load modules
# it will abort. It is possible to use multiple loadmodule directives.
#
# loadmodule /path/to/my_module.so
# loadmodule /path/to/other_module.so
 
################################## NETWORK #####################################
 
# By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, Redis listens
# for connections from all the network interfaces available on the server.
# It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using
# the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
# bind 127.0.0.1 ::1
#
# ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the
# internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the
# instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the
# following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only into
# the IPv4 loopback interface address (this means Redis will be able to
# accept connections only from clients running into the same computer it

################################# REPLICATION #################################
 
# Master-Replica replication. Use replicaof to make a Redis instance a copy of
# another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.
#
#   +------------------+      +---------------+
#   |      Master      | ---> |    Replica    |
#   | (receive writes) |      |  (exact copy) |
#   +------------------+      +---------------+
#
# 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to
#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least
#    a given number of replicas.
# 2) Redis replicas are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the
#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of
#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next
#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.
# 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a
#    network partition replicas automatically try to reconnect to masters
#    and resynchronize with them.
#
# replicaof <masterip> <masterport>
 
# If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
# directive below) it is possible to tell the replica to authenticate before
# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will
# refuse the replica request.
#
# masterauth <master-password>
 
# When a replica loses its connection with the master, or when the replication
# is still in progress, the replica can act in two different ways:
#
# 1) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the replica will
#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the
#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
#
# 2) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the replica will reply with
#    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all the kind of commands
#    but to INFO, replicaOF, AUTH, PING, SHUTDOWN, REPLCONF, ROLE, CONFIG,
#    SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, PSUBSCRIBE, PUNSUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, PUBSUB,
#    COMMAND, POST, HOST: and LATENCY.
#
replica-serve-stale-data yes
 
# You can configure a replica instance to accept writes or not. Writing against
# a replica instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data
# written on a replica will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but
# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a
# misconfiguration.
#
# Since Redis 2.6 by default replicas are read-only.
#
# Note: read only replicas are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients
# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.
# Still a read only replica exports by default all the administrative commands
# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve
# security of read only replicas using 'rename-command' to shadow all the
# administrative / dangerous commands.
replica-read-only yes
 
# Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------
# WARNING: DISKLESS REPLICATION IS EXPERIMENTAL CURRENTLY
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# New replicas and reconnecting replicas that are not able to continue the replication
# process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a "full
# synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the replicas.
# The transmission can happen in two different ways:
#
# 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB
#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent
#                 process to the replicas incrementally.
# 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the
#              RDB file to replica sockets, without touching the disk at all.
#
# With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more replicas
# can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child producing
# the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead once
# the transfer starts, new replicas arriving will be queued and a new transfer
# will start when the current one terminates.
#
# When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of
# time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple replicas
# will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.
#
# With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication
# works better.
repl-diskless-sync no
 
# When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay
# the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket
# to the replicas.
#
# This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve
# new replicas arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the server
# waits a delay in order to let more replicas arrive.
#
# The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable
# it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.
repl-diskless-sync-delay 5
 
# Replicas send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change
# this interval with the repl_ping_replica_period option. The default value is 10
# seconds.
#
# repl-ping-replica-period 10
 
# The following option sets the replication timeout for:
#
# 1) Bulk transfer I/O during SYNC, from the point of view of replica.
# 2) Master timeout from the point of view of replicas (data, pings).
# 3) Replica timeout from the point of view of masters (REPLCONF ACK pings).
#
# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value
# specified for repl-ping-replica-period otherwise a timeout will be detected
# every time there is low traffic between the master and the replica.
#
# repl-timeout 60
 
# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the replica socket after SYNC?
#
# If you select "yes" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and
# less bandwidth to send data to replicas. But this can add a delay for
# the data to appear on the replica side, up to 40 milliseconds with
# Linux kernels using a default configuration.
#
# If you select "no" the delay for data to appear on the replica side will
# be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.
#
# By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions
# or when the master and replicas are many hops away, turning this to "yes" may
# be a good idea.
repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no
 
# Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates
# replica data when replicas are disconnected for some time, so that when a replica
# wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a partial
# resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the replica missed while
# disconnected.
#
# The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the time the replica can be
# disconnected and later be able to perform a partial resynchronization.
#
# The backlog is only allocated once there is at least a replica connected.
#
# repl-backlog-size 1mb
 
# After a master has no longer connected replicas for some time, the backlog
# will be freed. The following option configures the amount of seconds that
# need to elapse, starting from the time the last replica disconnected, for
# the backlog buffer to be freed.
#
# Note that replicas never free the backlog for timeout, since they may be
# promoted to masters later, and should be able to correctly "partially
# resynchronize" with the replicas: hence they should always accumulate backlog.
#
# A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.
#
# repl-backlog-ttl 3600
 
# The replica priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO output.
# It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a replica to promote into a
# master if the master is no longer working correctly.
#
# A replica with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so
# for instance if there are three replicas with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will
# pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.
#
# However a special priority of 0 marks the replica as not able to perform the
# role of master, so a replica with priority of 0 will never be selected by
# Redis Sentinel for promotion.
#
# By default the priority is 100.
replica-priority 100
 
# It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than
# N replicas connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.
#
# The N replicas need to be in "online" state.
#
# The lag in seconds, that must be <= the specified value, is calculated from
# the last ping received from the replica, that is usually sent every second.
#
# This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but
# will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough replicas
# are available, to the specified number of seconds.
#
# For example to require at least 3 replicas with a lag <= 10 seconds use:
#
# min-replicas-to-write 3
# min-replicas-max-lag 10
#
# Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.
#
# By default min-replicas-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and
# min-replicas-max-lag is set to 10.
 
# A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached
# replicas in different ways. For example the "INFO replication" section
# offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by
# Redis Sentinel in order to discover replica instances.
# Another place where this info is available is in the output of the
# "ROLE" command of a master.
#
# The listed IP and address normally reported by a replica is obtained
# in the following way:
#
#   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address
#   of the socket used by the replica to connect with the master.
#
#   Port: The port is communicated by the replica during the replication
#   handshake, and is normally the port that the replica is using to
#   listen for connections.
#
# However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is
# used, the replica may be actually reachable via different IP and port
# pairs. The following two options can be used by a replica in order to
# report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO
# and ROLE will report those values.
#
# There is no need to use both the options if you need to override just
# the port or the IP address.
#
# replica-announce-ip 5.5.5.5
# replica-announce-port 1234

#
# This should stay commented out for backward compatibility and because most

#
# Warning: since Redis is pretty fast an outside user can try up to

# Command renaming.
#
# It is possible to change the name of dangerous commands in a shared

# hard to guess so that it will still be available for internal-use tools
# but not available for general clients.
#
# Example:
#
# rename-command CONFIG b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52
#
# It is also possible to completely kill a command by renaming it into
# an empty string:
#
# rename-command CONFIG ""
#
# Please note that changing the name of commands that are logged into the
# AOF file or transmitted to replicas may cause problems.
 
################################### CLIENTS ####################################
 
# Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default
# this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the Redis server is not
# able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit
# the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit
# minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).
#
# Once the limit is reached Redis will close all the new connections sending
# an error 'max number of clients reached'.
#
# maxclients 10000
 
############################## MEMORY MANAGEMENT ################################
 
# Set a memory usage limit to the specified amount of bytes.
# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys
# according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).
#
# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is
# set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands
# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue
# to reply to read-only commands like GET.
#
# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU or LFU cache, or to
# set a hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).
#
# WARNING: If you have replicas attached to an instance with maxmemory on,
# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the replicas are subtracted
# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will
# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output
# buffer of replicas is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion
# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.
#
# In short... if you have replicas attached it is suggested that you set a lower
# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for replica
# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').
#
# maxmemory <bytes>
 
# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
# is reached. You can select among five behaviors:
#
# volatile-lru -> Evict using approximated LRU among the keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lru -> Evict any key using approximated LRU.
# volatile-lfu -> Evict using approximated LFU among the keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lfu -> Evict any key using approximated LFU.
# volatile-random -> Remove a random key among the ones with an expire set.
# allkeys-random -> Remove a random key, any key.
# volatile-ttl -> Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
# noeviction -> Don't evict anything, just return an error on write operations.
#
# LRU means Least Recently Used
# LFU means Least Frequently Used
#
# Both LRU, LFU and volatile-ttl are implemented using approximated
# randomized algorithms.
#
# Note: with any of the above policies, Redis will return an error on write
#       operations, when there are no suitable keys for eviction.
#
#       At the date of writing these commands are: set setnx setex append
#       incr decr rpush lpush rpushx lpushx linsert lset rpoplpush sadd
#       sinter sinterstore sunion sunionstore sdiff sdiffstore zadd zincrby
#       zunionstore zinterstore hset hsetnx hmset hincrby incrby decrby
#       getset mset msetnx exec sort
#
# The default is:
#
# maxmemory-policy noeviction
 
# LRU, LFU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or
# accuracy. For default Redis will check five keys and pick the one that was
# used less recently, you can change the sample size using the following
# configuration directive.
#
# The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely
# true LRU but costs more CPU. 3 is faster but not very accurate.
#
# maxmemory-samples 5
 
# Starting from Redis 5, by default a replica will ignore its maxmemory setting
# (unless it is promoted to master after a failover or manually). It means
# that the eviction of keys will be just handled by the master, sending the
# DEL commands to the replica as keys evict in the master side.
#
# This behavior ensures that masters and replicas stay consistent, and is usually
# what you want, however if your replica is writable, or you want the replica to have
# a different memory setting, and you are sure all the writes performed to the
# replica are idempotent, then you may change this default (but be sure to understand
# what you are doing).
#
# Note that since the replica by default does not evict, it may end using more
# memory than the one set via maxmemory (there are certain buffers that may
# be larger on the replica, or data structures may sometimes take more memory and so
# forth). So make sure you monitor your replicas and make sure they have enough
# memory to never hit a real out-of-memory condition before the master hits
# the configured maxmemory setting.
#
# replica-ignore-maxmemory yes
 
############################# LAZY FREEING ####################################
 
# Redis has two primitives to delete keys. One is called DEL and is a blocking
# deletion of the object. It means that the server stops processing new commands
# in order to reclaim all the memory associated with an object in a synchronous
# way. If the key deleted is associated with a small object, the time needed
# in order to execute the DEL command is very small and comparable to most other
# O(1) or O(log_N) commands in Redis. However if the key is associated with an
# aggregated value containing millions of elements, the server can block for
# a long time (even seconds) in order to complete the operation.
#
# For the above reasons Redis also offers non blocking deletion primitives
# such as UNLINK (non blocking DEL) and the ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and
# FLUSHDB commands, in order to reclaim memory in background. Those commands
# are executed in constant time. Another thread will incrementally free the
# object in the background as fast as possible.
#
# DEL, UNLINK and ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and FLUSHDB are user-controlled.
# It's up to the design of the application to understand when it is a good
# idea to use one or the other. However the Redis server sometimes has to
# delete keys or flush the whole database as a side effect of other operations.
# Specifically Redis deletes objects independently of a user call in the
# following scenarios:
#
# 1) On eviction, because of the maxmemory and maxmemory policy configurations,
#    in order to make room for new data, without going over the specified
#    memory limit.
# 2) Because of expire: when a key with an associated time to live (see the
#    EXPIRE command) must be deleted from memory.
# 3) Because of a side effect of a command that stores data on a key that may
#    already exist. For example the RENAME command may delete the old key
#    content when it is replaced with another one. Similarly SUNIONSTORE
#    or SORT with STORE option may delete existing keys. The SET command
#    itself removes any old content of the specified key in order to replace
#    it with the specified string.
# 4) During replication, when a replica performs a full resynchronization with
#    its master, the content of the whole database is removed in order to
#    load the RDB file just transferred.
#
# In all the above cases the default is to delete objects in a blocking way,
# like if DEL was called. However you can configure each case specifically
# in order to instead release memory in a non-blocking way like if UNLINK
# was called, using the following configuration directives:
 
lazyfree-lazy-eviction no
lazyfree-lazy-expire no
lazyfree-lazy-server-del no
replica-lazy-flush no
 
############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################
 
# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or
# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
# the configured save points).
#
# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a
# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is
# still running correctly.
#
# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file
# with the better durability guarantees.
#
# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.
 
appendonly no
 
# The name of the append only file (default: "appendonly.aof")
 
appendfilename "appendonly.aof"
 
# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
#
# Redis supports three different modes:
#
# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
#
# The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between
# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
# "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
# or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than
# everysec.
#
# More details please check the following article:
# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html
#
# If unsure, use "everysec".
 
# appendfsync always
appendfsync everysec

# our synchronous write(2) call.
#
# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
#
# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is
# the same as "appendfsync none". In practical terms, this means that it is
# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the
# default Linux settings).
#
# If you have latency problems turn this to "yes". Otherwise leave it as
# "no" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.

# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.
# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling
# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.
#
# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the
# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of
# the AOF at startup is used).
#
# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is
# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also
# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this
# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase
# is reached but it is still pretty small.
#
# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF
# rewrite feature.

# An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis
# startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.
# This may happen when the system where Redis is running
# crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the
# data=ordered option (however this can't happen when Redis itself
# crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).
#
# Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much
# data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found
# to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.
#
# If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and
# the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.
# Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error
# and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires
# to fix the AOF file using the "redis-check-aof" utility before to restart
# the server.
#
# Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle
# the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when
# Redis will try to read more data from the AOF file but not enough bytes
# will be found.
aof-load-truncated yes
 
# When rewriting the AOF file, Redis is able to use an RDB preamble in the
# AOF file for faster rewrites and recoveries. When this option is turned
# on the rewritten AOF file is composed of two different stanzas:
#
#   [RDB file][AOF tail]
#
# When loading Redis recognizes that the AOF file starts with the "REDIS"
# string and loads the prefixed RDB file, and continues loading the AOF
# tail.

#
# When a long running script exceeds the maximum execution time only the
# SCRIPT KILL and SHUTDOWN NOSAVE commands are available. The first can be
# used to stop a script that did not yet called write commands. The second
# is the only way to shut down the server in the case a write command was
# already issued by the script but the user doesn't want to wait for the natural
# termination of the script.

################################ REDIS CLUSTER  ###############################
 
# Normal Redis instances can't be part of a Redis Cluster; only nodes that are
# started as cluster nodes can. In order to start a Redis instance as a
# cluster node enable the cluster support uncommenting the following:
#
# cluster-enabled yes
 
# Every cluster node has a cluster configuration file. This file is not
# intended to be edited by hand. It is created and updated by Redis nodes.
# Every Redis Cluster node requires a different cluster configuration file.
# Make sure that instances running in the same system do not have
# overlapping cluster configuration file names.
#
# cluster-config-file nodes-6379.conf
 
# Cluster node timeout is the amount of milliseconds a node must be unreachable
# for it to be considered in failure state.
# Most other internal time limits are multiple of the node timeout.
#
# cluster-node-timeout 15000
 
# A replica of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data
# looks too old.
#
# There is no simple way for a replica to actually have an exact measure of
# its "data age", so the following two checks are performed:
#
# 1) If there are multiple replicas able to failover, they exchange messages
#    in order to try to give an advantage to the replica with the best
#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).
#    Replicas will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start
#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.
#
# 2) Every single replica computes the time of the last interaction with
#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master
#    is still in the "connected" state), or the time that elapsed since the
#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).
#    If the last interaction is too old, the replica will not try to failover
#    at all.
#
# The point "2" can be tuned by user. Specifically a replica will not perform
# the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time
# elapsed is greater than:
#
#   (node-timeout * replica-validity-factor) + repl-ping-replica-period
#
# So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the replica-validity-factor
# is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-replica-period of 10 seconds, the
# replica will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master
# for longer than 310 seconds.
#
# A large replica-validity-factor may allow replicas with too old data to failover
# a master, while a too small value may prevent the cluster from being able to
# elect a replica at all.
#
# For maximum availability, it is possible to set the replica-validity-factor
# to a value of 0, which means, that replicas will always try to failover the
# master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.
# (However they'll always try to apply a delay proportional to their
# offset rank).
#
# Zero is the only value able to guarantee that when all the partitions heal
# the cluster will always be able to continue.
#
# cluster-replica-validity-factor 10
 
# Cluster replicas are able to migrate to orphaned masters, that are masters
# that are left without working replicas. This improves the cluster ability
# to resist to failures as otherwise an orphaned master can't be failed over
# in case of failure if it has no working replicas.
#
# Replicas migrate to orphaned masters only if there are still at least a
# given number of other working replicas for their old master. This number
# is the "migration barrier". A migration barrier of 1 means that a replica
# will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working replica for its master
# and so forth. It usually reflects the number of replicas you want for every
# master in your cluster.
#
# Default is 1 (replicas migrate only if their masters remain with at least
# one replica). To disable migration just set it to a very large value.
# A value of 0 can be set but is useful only for debugging and dangerous
# in production.
#
# cluster-migration-barrier 1
 
# By default Redis Cluster nodes stop accepting queries if they detect there
# is at least an hash slot uncovered (no available node is serving it).
# This way if the cluster is partially down (for example a range of hash slots
# are no longer covered) all the cluster becomes, eventually, unavailable.
# It automatically returns available as soon as all the slots are covered again.
#
# However sometimes you want the subset of the cluster which is working,
# to continue to accept queries for the part of the key space that is still
# covered. In order to do so, just set the cluster-require-full-coverage
# option to no.
#
# cluster-require-full-coverage yes
 
# This option, when set to yes, prevents replicas from trying to failover its
# master during master failures. However the master can still perform a
# manual failover, if forced to do so.
#
# This is useful in different scenarios, especially in the case of multiple
# data center operations, where we want one side to never be promoted if not
# in the case of a total DC failure.
#
# cluster-replica-no-failover no
 
# In order to setup your cluster make sure to read the documentation
# available at http://redis.io web site.
 
########################## CLUSTER DOCKER/NAT support  ########################
 
# In certain deployments, Redis Cluster nodes address discovery fails, because
# addresses are NAT-ted or because ports are forwarded (the typical case is
# Docker and other containers).
#
# In order to make Redis Cluster working in such environments, a static
# configuration where each node knows its public address is needed. The
# following two options are used for this scope, and are:
#
# * cluster-announce-ip
# * cluster-announce-port
# * cluster-announce-bus-port
#
# Each instruct the node about its address, client port, and cluster message
# bus port. The information is then published in the header of the bus packets
# so that other nodes will be able to correctly map the address of the node
# publishing the information.
#
# If the above options are not used, the normal Redis Cluster auto-detection
# will be used instead.
#
# Note that when remapped, the bus port may not be at the fixed offset of
# clients port + 10000, so you can specify any port and bus-port depending
# on how they get remapped. If the bus-port is not set, a fixed offset of
# 10000 will be used as usually.
#
# Example:
#
# cluster-announce-ip 10.1.1.5
# cluster-announce-port 6379
# cluster-announce-bus-port 6380
 
################################## SLOW LOG ###################################
 
# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations
# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
# other requests in the meantime).
#
# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis
# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
# queue of logged commands.
 
# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while
# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
slowlog-log-slower-than 10000
 
# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.

################################ LATENCY MONITOR ##############################
 
# The Redis latency monitoring subsystem samples different operations
# at runtime in order to collect data related to possible sources of
# latency of a Redis instance.
#
# Via the LATENCY command this information is available to the user that can
# print graphs and obtain reports.
#
# The system only logs operations that were performed in a time equal or
# greater than the amount of milliseconds specified via the
# latency-monitor-threshold configuration directive. When its value is set
# to zero, the latency monitor is turned off.
#
# By default latency monitoring is disabled since it is mostly not needed
# if you don't have latency issues, and collecting data has a performance
# impact, that while very small, can be measured under big load. Latency
# monitoring can easily be enabled at runtime using the command
# "CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold <milliseconds>" if needed.
latency-monitor-threshold 0
 
############################# EVENT NOTIFICATION ##############################
 
# Redis can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.
# This feature is documented at http://redis.io/topics/notifications
#
# For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client
# performs a DEL operation on key "foo" stored in the Database 0, two
# messages will be published via Pub/Sub:
#
# PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del
# PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo
#
# It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set
# of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:
#
#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@<db>__ prefix.
#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@<db>__ prefix.
#  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...
#  $     String commands
#  l     List commands
#  s     Set commands
#  h     Hash commands
#  z     Sorted set commands
#  x     Expired events (events generated every time a key expires)
#  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)
#  A     Alias for g$lshzxe, so that the "AKE" string means all the events.
#
#  The "notify-keyspace-events" takes as argument a string that is composed
#  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications
#  are disabled.
#
#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the
#           event name, use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Elg
#
#  Example 2: to get the stream of the expired keys subscribing to channel
#             name __keyevent@0__:expired use:
#
  notify-keyspace-events Ex
#
#  By default all notifications are disabled because most users don't need
#  this feature and the feature has some overhead. Note that if you don't
#  specify at least one of K or E, no events will be delivered.

# threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.
hash-max-ziplist-entries 512
hash-max-ziplist-value 64
 
# Lists are also encoded in a special way to save a lot of space.
# The number of entries allowed per internal list node can be specified

# For a fixed maximum size, use -5 through -1, meaning:
# -5: max size: 64 Kb  <-- not recommended for normal workloads
# -4: max size: 32 Kb  <-- not recommended
# -3: max size: 16 Kb  <-- probably not recommended
# -2: max size: 8 Kb   <-- good
# -1: max size: 4 Kb   <-- good
# Positive numbers mean store up to _exactly_ that number of elements
# per list node.
# The highest performing option is usually -2 (8 Kb size) or -1 (4 Kb size),
# but if your use case is unique, adjust the settings as necessary.

# Lists may also be compressed.
# Compress depth is the number of quicklist ziplist nodes from *each* side of
# the list to *exclude* from compression.  The head and tail of the list

# 0: disable all list compression
# 1: depth 1 means "don't start compressing until after 1 node into the list,
#    going from either the head or tail"
#    So: [head]->node->node->...->node->[tail]
#    [head], [tail] will always be uncompressed; inner nodes will compress.
# 2: [head]->[next]->node->node->...->node->[prev]->[tail]
#    2 here means: don't compress head or head->next or tail->prev or tail,
#    but compress all nodes between them.
# 3: [head]->[next]->[next]->node->node->...->node->[prev]->[prev]->[tail]
# etc.

# Sets have a special encoding in just one case: when a set is composed

# this limit, it is converted into the dense representation.
#
# A value greater than 16000 is totally useless, since at that point the
# dense representation is more memory efficient.
#
# The suggested value is ~ 3000 in order to have the benefits of
# the space efficient encoding without slowing down too much PFADD,
# which is O(N) with the sparse encoding. The value can be raised to

# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in

# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table
# that is rehashing, the more rehashing "steps" are performed, so if the
# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used
# by the hash table.
#
# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to
# actively rehash the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.
#
# If unsure:
# use "activerehashing no" if you have hard latency requirements and it is
# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply from time to time
# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.

# The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients
# that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a
# common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the
# publisher can produce them).
#
# The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:
#
# normal -> normal clients including MONITOR clients
# replica  -> replica clients
# pubsub -> clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern
#
# The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:
#
# client-output-buffer-limit <class> <hard limit> <soft limit> <soft seconds>
#
# A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if
# the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of
# seconds (continuously).
# So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is
# 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately
# if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get
# disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes
# the limit for 10 seconds.
#
# By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data
# without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only
# asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster
# than it can read.
#
# Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and replica clients, since
# subscribers and replicas receive data in a push fashion.
#
# Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.

# Client query buffers accumulate new commands. They are limited to a fixed

# Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like
# closing connections of clients in timeout, purging expired keys that are
# never requested, and so forth.
#
# Not all tasks are performed with the same frequency, but Redis checks for
# tasks to perform according to the specified "hz" value.
#
# By default "hz" is set to 10. Raising the value will use more CPU when
# Redis is idle, but at the same time will make Redis more responsive when
# there are many keys expiring at the same time, and timeouts may be
# handled with more precision.
#
# The range is between 1 and 500, however a value over 100 is usually not
# a good idea. Most users should use the default of 10 and raise this up to
# 100 only in environments where very low latency is required.
hz 10
 
# Normally it is useful to have an HZ value which is proportional to the
# number of clients connected. This is useful in order, for instance, to
# avoid too many clients are processed for each background task invocation
# in order to avoid latency spikes.
#
# Since the default HZ value by default is conservatively set to 10, Redis
# offers, and enables by default, the ability to use an adaptive HZ value
# which will temporary raise when there are many connected clients.
#
# When dynamic HZ is enabled, the actual configured HZ will be used as
# as a baseline, but multiples of the configured HZ value will be actually
# used as needed once more clients are connected. In this way an idle

# Redis LFU eviction (see maxmemory setting) can be tuned. However it is a good
# idea to start with the default settings and only change them after investigating
# how to improve the performances and how the keys LFU change over time, which
# is possible to inspect via the OBJECT FREQ command.
#
# There are two tunable parameters in the Redis LFU implementation: the
# counter logarithm factor and the counter decay time. It is important to
# understand what the two parameters mean before changing them.
#
# The LFU counter is just 8 bits per key, it's maximum value is 255, so Redis
# uses a probabilistic increment with logarithmic behavior. Given the value
# of the old counter, when a key is accessed, the counter is incremented in
# this way:
#
# 1. A random number R between 0 and 1 is extracted.
# 2. A probability P is calculated as 1/(old_value*lfu_log_factor+1).
# 3. The counter is incremented only if R < P.
#
# The default lfu-log-factor is 10. This is a table of how the frequency
# counter changes with a different number of accesses with different
# logarithmic factors:
#
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | factor | 100 hits   | 1000 hits  | 100K hits  | 1M hits    | 10M hits   |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 0      | 104        | 255        | 255        | 255        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 1      | 18         | 49         | 255        | 255        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 10     | 10         | 18         | 142        | 255        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 100    | 8          | 11         | 49         | 143        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
#
# NOTE: The above table was obtained by running the following commands:
#
#   redis-benchmark -n 1000000 incr foo
#   redis-cli object freq foo
#
# NOTE 2: The counter initial value is 5 in order to give new objects a chance
# to accumulate hits.
#
# The counter decay time is the time, in minutes, that must elapse in order
# for the key counter to be divided by two (or decremented if it has a value
# less <= 10).
#
# The default value for the lfu-decay-time is 1. A Special value of 0 means to
# decay the counter every time it happens to be scanned.

########################### ACTIVE DEFRAGMENTATION #######################
#
# WARNING THIS FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL. However it was stress tested
# even in production and manually tested by multiple engineers for some
# time.
#
# What is active defragmentation?
# -------------------------------
#
# Active (online) defragmentation allows a Redis server to compact the
# spaces left between small allocations and deallocations of data in memory,
# thus allowing to reclaim back memory.
#
# Fragmentation is a natural process that happens with every allocator (but
# less so with Jemalloc, fortunately) and certain workloads. Normally a server
# restart is needed in order to lower the fragmentation, or at least to flush
# away all the data and create it again. However thanks to this feature
# implemented by Oran Agra for Redis 4.0 this process can happen at runtime
# in an "hot" way, while the server is running.
#
# Basically when the fragmentation is over a certain level (see the
# configuration options below) Redis will start to create new copies of the
# values in contiguous memory regions by exploiting certain specific Jemalloc
# features (in order to understand if an allocation is causing fragmentation
# and to allocate it in a better place), and at the same time, will release the
# old copies of the data. This process, repeated incrementally for all the keys
# will cause the fragmentation to drop back to normal values.
#
# Important things to understand:
#
# 1. This feature is disabled by default, and only works if you compiled Redis
#    to use the copy of Jemalloc we ship with the source code of Redis.
#    This is the default with Linux builds.
#
# 2. You never need to enable this feature if you don't have fragmentation
#    issues.
#
# 3. Once you experience fragmentation, you can enable this feature when
#    needed with the command "CONFIG SET activedefrag yes".
#
# The configuration parameters are able to fine tune the behavior of the
# defragmentation process. If you are not sure about what they mean it is
# a good idea to leave the defaults untouched.
 
# Enabled active defragmentation

# Minimum amount of fragmentation waste to start active defrag

·使用redis6.0.8镜像创建容器(也叫运行镜像)
docker run  -p 6379:6379 --name myr3 --privileged=true -v /app/redis/redis.conf:/etc/redis/redis.conf -v /app/redis/data:/data -d redis:6.0.8 redis-server /etc/redis/redis.conf

·测试redis-cli连接上来
 docker exec -it 运行着Rediis服务的容器ID redis-cli

·请证明docker启动使用了我们自己指定的配置文件
·修改前
我们用的配置文件，数据库默认是16个
·修改后
宿主机的修改会同步给docker容器里面的配置。
·记得重启服务
·测试redis-cli连接上来第2次
